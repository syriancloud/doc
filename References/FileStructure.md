# File Structure
 Of course there isn’t a best way to organize your files, but there are some ways which are better than others.

 In here modules directory holds data-related files.  we divided the files to group similar files together.


#### Finally, our application would be structured like that:
````shell
    your-project/
    ├── docs
    │      └── DeveloperGuide.md
    ├── public
    │   └── assets
    │       └── img
    │       └── log
    │   └── index.html
    │   └── manifest.json
    │   └── index.html
    │   └── robots.txt
    ├── src
    │   └── sass
    │   └── app
    │      └── components
    │      └── containers
    │      └── views
    │      └── Main.js
    │      └── Main.test.js
    │   └── index.js
    │   └── serviceWorker.js
    │   └── setupTests.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md

In fact, you will discover as you browse websites and develop your own, that it is useful to have a separate set of folders for generally useful components. For example, an Assets folder could contain files for GIF buttons, GIF or JPEG icons, JavaScript programmes, Acrobat PDF documents, and JPEG photographs: [A Guide to a Website Structure](https://flowmapp.com/a-guide-to-a-website-structure/)
